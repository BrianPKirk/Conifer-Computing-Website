    <p class="text">
        Conifer Computing Company, or Conifer, was founded in the early summer of 2022 by high school friends
        Thadd Schelp, Michael Steuber, and Brian Kirk. Work proceeded on Conifer's first project, but eventually, it
        was deemed too big a task for Conifer's small team and the company restructured to begin development on a
        new line of products: middleware. Specifically, plugin software for the Unity and Unreal game engines. With
        our new software release imminent, we are looking for programmers to join our team.

            <h3>CTO, Head Honcho</h3>
            <p class="bio-text">
                Thadd Schelp, our Head Honcho, is responsible for the technical direction we go in as a company.
                He doesn't like his picture taken, hence the above image.
                Our original project as a company was started by him two years prior to our formation,
                and he's been leading our software development ever since.
                He enjoys Doom Eternal, Red Dead Redemption II, programming, and the outdoors or something.

            <h3>COO</h3>
            <p class="bio-text">
                Michael Steuber, our COO, is responsible for keeping all of us in line
                and for planning out our day-to-day operations.
                He hasn't had a haircut in four years, and we aren't sure if he's bathed too.
                He has devoutly worked on our projects ever since he joined the company.
                We call him Steuber because Michael is an abysmal name.
                Steuber enjoys playing various instruments and the outdoors or something.

                Brian Kirk, our CEO, is the author of these bios.
                He is also responsible for our business development.
                He doesn't need a haircut because he, unfortunately for him, is balding.
                Brian has worked with Thadd to grow the company ever since it was founded.
                He enjoys writing in the third person, playing and listening to music<a href="https://plini.bandcamp.com/music">,</a> and the outdoors or something.

    <h2 class="secondary-title">What's to come?</h2>
    <p class="text">
        In the coming months, we at Conifer are set to release our first product! After that, we’ve got a
        roadmap of planned projects which we will start and finish in the next twelve months (how exciting).
        All the aforementioned projects may or may not involve the creation of cross-platform Unreal Engine
        and Unity Engine plugins. Eventually, we will resume work on our proprietary game engine, once we’ve
        accumulated enough resources to do so (finally making Thadd happy again). As stated in the first
        paragraph, we are currently looking to expand our team of developers in order to create our empire,
        so for anyone looking to join up, go to the contact page.
