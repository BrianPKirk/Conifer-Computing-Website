			<h1>Conifer<br>Computing Company</h1>
			<p>Conifer Computing Company, or Conifer, was founded in the early summer of 2022 by highschool friends<br>
				Thadd Schelp, Michael Steuber, and Brian Kirk. Work proceeded on Conifer's first project, a game engine<br>
				 which had been in development for two years prior. Eventually, it was deemed too big a task for Conifer's small team<br>
				and the company restructured to begin development of a new line of products - middleware - specifically plugin software<br>
				for the Unity and Unreal engines. With our new software release imminent, we are looking for programmers to join our team.</p>

	<p><b><br>CTO, Head Honcho</b><br>
		<br>
		Thadd Schelp, our glorious CTO, is responsible for <br>
		the technical direction we go in as a company. He <br>
		doesn’t like his picture taken, so the above image <br>
		should suffice. Our original project as a company <br>
		was started by him two years prior to our formation, <br>
		and he’s been leading our software development ever <br>
		since. He enjoys playing Doom Eternal and coding.</p>

	<p><b><br>COO</b><br>
		<br>
		Michael Steuber, our COO, is responsible for keeping <br>
		all of us in line and for planning out our day to day <br>
		operations. He hasn’t had a haircut in four years and <br>
		we aren’t sure if he’s bathed either. He has devoutly <br>
		worked on our projects ever since he joined the company. <br>
		We call him Steuber because Michael is an abysmal name. <br>
		Steuber enjoys playing various instruments and the <br>
		outdoors or something. </p>

	<p><b><br>CEO</b><br>
		<br>
		Brian Kirk, our CEO, is the author of these bios. <br>
		He is also responsible for our business development. <br>
		He doesn’t need a haircut because he, unfortunately <br> 
		for him, is balding. Brian has worked with Thadd to <br>
		grow the company ever since it was founded. He <br>
		enjoys writing in the third person, playing music, <br>
		and the outdoors or something.

			<h1>What's to come?</h1>
			<p>In the coming months, we at Conifer are set to release our first product! After that, we’ve got a roadmap of planned projects which we will<br>
			start and finish in the next twelve months (how exciting). All of the aforementioned projects may or may not involve the creation of cross-platform Unreal Engine and Unity Engine plugins. <br>
			Eventually, we will resume work on our proprietary game engine, once we’ve accumulated enough resources to do so (finally making Thadd happy again). As stated in the first paragraph, we are currently<br>
			looking to expand our team of developers in order to create our empire, so for anyone looking to join up, go to the contact page. </p>
